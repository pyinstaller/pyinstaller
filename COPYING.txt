PyInstaller is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License,
or (at your option) any later version.


Bootloader Exception
--------------------

In addition to the permissions in the GNU General Public License, the
authors give you unlimited permission to link or embed compiled bootloader
and related files into combinations with other programs, and to distribute
those combinations without any restriction coming from the use of those
files. (The General Public License restrictions do apply in other respects;
for example, they cover modification of the files, and distribution when
not linked into a combine executable.)
 
 
Bootloader and Related Files
----------------------------

Bootloader and related files are files which are embedded within the
final executable. This includes files in directories:

./bootloader/
./PyInstaller/loader

 
About the PyInstaller Development Team
--------------------------------------

The PyInstaller Development Team is the set of contributors

``doc/CREDITS.rst``.

Our Copyright Policy
--------------------

PyInstaller uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
over their contributions to PyInstaller. But, it is important to note that these
contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus,
the PyInstaller source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single
person or institution.  Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire
PyInstaller Development Team.  If individual contributors want to maintain
a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they
should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they
commit the change to the PyInstaller repository.

With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file
to indicate the copyright and license terms:


#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Copyright (c) 2005-20l5, PyInstaller Development Team.
#
# Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License with exception
# for distributing bootloader.
#
# The full license is in the file COPYING.txt, distributed with this software.
