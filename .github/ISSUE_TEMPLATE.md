Please mind that PyInstaller is a voluntary project. We spent quite some time
for writing these guides to make both you and us lifes easier. Please
understand that we are not willed to spend our spare time to help you if you
are not willed to help on your side. (Sorry for having to said this, but we
are tired about asking the same question over and over again.)
