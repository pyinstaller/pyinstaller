  # Ubuntu 12.04 (LTS) packages installed into this Travis-CI container. Since
  # Ubuntu 12.04 provides *NO* Python 3 packages prefixed by "python3-", only
  # Python 2.7 packages prefixed by "python-" are installable. Installing only
  # Python 2.7 packages would be useless, however! Python packages should thus
  # be installed by "pip" via the "test/requirements-library.txt" specification.
  #
  # Travis-CI intends to add support for Ubuntu 14.04 (LTS) at some future date.
