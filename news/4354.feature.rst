Add a splash screen that displays a background image and text:
The splash screen can be controlled from within Python using the ``pyi_splash`` module.
A splash screen can be added using the ``--splash IMAGE_FILE`` option.
If optional text is enabled, the splash screen will show the progress of unpacking in
onefile mode.
This feature is currently tested against Windows and Linux, but might work on non-
default python installations on macOS.
A huge thanks to `@Chrisg2000 <https://github.com/Chrisg2000>`_ for programming this feature.
