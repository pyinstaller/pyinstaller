UPX is not enabled by default anymore (even if available and supported
on the target OS, i.e., Windows). Instead of opting out of its use with
:option:`noupx`, it must now be explicitly opted in using :option:`upx`,
or by setting ``upx=True`` in the spec file. The change applies only to
newly-generated spec files (including spec files that are generated
on-the-fly).
