How To Contribute
=====================

**You are very welcome to contribute!**
|PyInstaller| is a maintained by a group of volunteers.
All contributions,
like community support, bug reports, bug fixes,
documentation improvements, enhancements and ideas are welcome.

|PyInstaller| is an free software project that is created and
maintained by volunteers.
It lives-and-dies based on the support it receives from others, and the fact
that you're even considering contributing to |PyInstaller| is very
generous of you.

.. TODO: Add this: At `Pyinstaller.org`_ you find links to the mailing list,
  IRC channel, and Git repository,
  and the important `How to Contribute`_ link.
  Contributions to code and documentation are welcome,
  as well as tested hooks for installing other packages.

  * The code can be found in a Git repository, at
    https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/.
  * Issues and feature requests should be raised in the tracker.
  * The mailing list for development is at Google Groups.
  * There is also the #sphinx-doc IRC channel on freenode.

Since as of now all core-developers are working on PyInstaller in their
spare-time, you can help us (and the project) most if you are following some
simple guidelines. The higher the quality of your contribution, the less work
we have incorporating them and the earlier we will be able to incorporate them
:-)


If you get stuck at any point you can ask on the
`PyInstaller Email List`_
or `create a ticket on GitHub
<https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/new>`_.


For more about our development process and methods, see the
:ref:`development guide`.

  requester to provide missing information and to try with the latest
  development version; ensure there is a *minimal* example; ensure the
  issue-reporter followed all steps in :ref:`When things go wrong`.
  If you are able reproduce the
  problem and track down the bug, this would be a *great* help for the
  core developers.
