.. _ctypes dependencies:

Ctypes Dependencies
=========================

Ctypes is a foreign function library for Python, that allows calling functions
present in shared libraries. Those libraries are not imported as Python
packages, because they are not picked up via Python imports: their path is
passed to ctypes instead, which deals with the shared library directly; this
caused <1.4 PyInstaller import detect machinery to miss those libraries,
failing the goal to build self-contained PyInstaller executables::

  from ctypes import *
  # This will pass undetected under PyInstaller detect machinery,
  # because it's not a direct import.
  handle = CDLL("/usr/lib/library.so")
  handle.function_call()


Solution in |PyInstaller|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyInstaller contains a pragmatic implementation of Ctypes dependencies: it
will search for simple standard usages of ctypes and **automatically** track
and bundle the referenced libraries. The following usages will be correctly
detected::

  CDLL("library.so")
  WinDLL("library.so")
  ctypes.DLL("library.so")
  cdll.library # Only valid under Windows - a limitation of ctypes, not PyInstaller's
  windll.library # Only valid under Windows - a limitation of ctypes, not PyInstaller's
  cdll.LoadLibrary("library.so")
  windll.LoadLibrary("library.so")


More in detail, the following restrictions apply:

* **only libraries referenced by bare filenames (e.g. no leading paths) will
  be handled**; handling absolute paths would be impossible without modifying
  the bytecode as well (remember that while running frozen, ctypes would keep
  searching the library at that very absolute location, whose presence on the
  host system nobody can guarantee), and relative paths handling would require
  recreating in the frozen executable the same hierarchy of directories
  leading to the library, in addition of keeping track of which the current
  working directory is;

* **only library paths represented by a literal string will be detected and
  included in the final executable**: PyInstaller import detection works by
  inspecting raw Python bytecode, and since you can pass the library path to
  ctypes using a string (that can be represented by a literal in the code, but
  also by a variable, by the return value of an arbitrarily complex function,
  etc...), it's not reasonably possible to detect **all** ctypes dependencies;

* **only libraries referenced in the same context of ctypes' invocation will
  be handled**.

We feel that it should be enough to cover most ctypes' usages, with little or
no modification required in your code.

If |PyInstaller| does not detect a library, you can add it to your
bundle by passing the respective information to :option:`--add-binary` option or
:ref:`listing it in the .spec-file <adding binary files>`. If your frozen
application will be able to pick up the library at run-time can not be
guaranteed as it depends on the detailed implementation.


Gotchas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ctypes detection system at :ref:`Analysis time <spec-file operations>`
is based on :func:`ctypes.util.find_library`.
This means that you have to make sure
that while performing ``Analysis`` and running frozen,
all the environment values :func:`~ctypes.util.find_library` uses to search libraries
are aligned to those when running un-frozen.
Examples include using ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` or ``DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`` to
widen :func:`~ctypes.util.find_library` scope.


SWIG support
=========================

|PyInstaller| tries to detect binary modules created by SWIG. This detection
requires:

- The Python wrapper module must be imported somewhere in your application
  (or by any of the modules it uses).

- The wrapper module must be available as source-code and it's first line must
  contain the text ``automatically generated by SWIG``.

- The C-module must have the same name as the wrapper module prefixed with an
  underscore (``_``). (This is a SWIG restriction already.)

- The C-module must sit just beside the wrapper module (thus a relative import
  would work).

Also some restrictions apply, due to the way the SWIG wrapper is
implemented:

- The C-module will become a `global` module. As a consequence, you can not
  use two SWIG modules with the same basename (e.g. ``pkg1._cmod`` and
  ``pkg2._cmod``), as one would overwrite the other.


Cython support
======================

|PyInstaller| can follow import statements that refer to Cython C object
modules and bundle them – like for any other module implemented in C.

But – again, as for any other module implemented in C – |PyInstaller| can not
determine if the Cython C object module is importing some Python module.
These will typically show up as in a traceback like this
(mind the ``.pyx`` extension)::

    Traceback (most recent call last):
    […]
    File "myapp\cython_module.pyx", line 3, in init myapp.cython_module
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'csv'

So if you are using a Cython C object module, which imports Python modules,
you will have to list these as :option:`--hidden-import`.


macOS multi-arch support
========================

With the introduction of Apple Silicon M1, there are now several architecture
options available for python:

- single-arch ``x86_64`` with thin binaries: older `python.org` builds,
  `Homebrew`_ python running natively on Intel Macs or under `rosetta2`
  on M1 Macs
- single-arch ``arm64`` with thin binaries: `Homebrew`_ python running
  natively on M1 macs
- multi-arch ``universal2`` with fat binaries (i.e., containing both
  ``x86_64`` and ``arm64`` slices): recent ``universal2`` `python.org`
  builds

|PyInstaller| aims to support all possible combinations stemming from
the above options:

- single-arch application created using corresponding single-arch python
- ``universal2`` application created using ``universal2`` python
- single-arch application created using ``universal2`` python (i.e.,
  reducing ``universal2`` fat binaries into either ``x86_64`` or ``arm64``
  thin binaries)

**By default, PyInstaller targets the current running architecture
and produces a single-arch binary** (``x86_64`` when running on Intel Mac
or under `rosetta2` on M1 Mac, or ``arm64`` when running on M1 Mac). The
reason for that is that even with a ``universal2`` python environment,
some packages may end up providing only single-arch binaries, making it
impossible to create a functional ``universal2`` frozen application.

The alternative options, such as creating a ``universal2`` version
of frozen application, or creating a non-native single-arch version using
``universal2`` environment, must therefore be explicitly enabled. This
can be done either by specifying the target architecture in the ``.spec``
file via the ``target_arch=`` argument to ``EXE()``, or on command-line
via the :option:`--target-arch` switch. Valid values are ``x86_64``, ``arm64``,
and ``universal2``.


Architecture validation during binary collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To prevent run-time issues caused by missing or mismatched architecture slices
in binaries, the binary collection process performs strict architecture validation.
It checks whether collected binary files contain required arch slice(s), and if
not, the build process is aborted with an error message about the problematic
binary.

In such cases, creating frozen application for the selected target
architecture will not be possible unless the problem of missing arch slices
is manually addressed (for example, by downloading the wheel corresponding to
the missing architecture, and stiching the offending binary files together
using the ``lipo`` utility).

.. versionchanged:: 4.10
   In earlier |PyInstaller| versions, the architecture validation was performed
   on all collected binaries, such as python extension modules and the
   shared libraries referenced by those extensions. As of |PyInstaller| 4.10,
   the architecture validation is limited to only python extension modules.

   The individual architecture slices in a multi-arch ``universal2`` extension
   may be linked against (slices in) ``universal2`` shared libraries, or
   against distinct single-arch thin shared libraries. This latter case makes
   it impossible to reliably validate architecture of the collected shared
   libraries w.r.t. the target application architecture.

   However, the extension modules do need to be fully compatible with the target
   application architecture. Therefore, their continued validation should
   hopefully suffice to detect attempts at using incompatible single-arch
   python packages [*]_.

.. [*] Although nothing really prevents a package from having distinct,
   architecture-specific extension modules...


Trimming fat binaries for single-arch targets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When targeting a single architecture, the build process extracts the
corresponding arch slice from any collected fat binaries, including the
bootloader. This results in a completely thin build even when building
in ``universal2`` python environment.


macOS binary code signing
=========================

With Apple Silicon M1 architecture, macOS introduced mandatory code signing,
even if ad-hoc (i.e., without actual code-signing identity). This means
that ``arm64`` arch slices (but possibly also ``x86_64`` ones, especially
in ``universal2`` binaries) in collected binaries always come with signature.

The processing of binaries done by |PyInstaller| (e.g., library path
rewriting in binaries' headers) invalidates their signatures. Therefore,
the signatures need to be re-generated, otherwise the OS refuses to load
a binary.

**By default, PyInstaller ad-hoc (re)signs all collected binaries and
the generated executable itself.** Instead of ad-hoc signing, it is also
possible to use real code-signing identity. To do so, either specify your
identity in the ``.spec`` file via ``codesign_identity=`` argument to
``EXE()`` , or on command-line via the :option:`--codesign-identity` switch.

Being able to provide codesign identity allows user to ensure that all
collected binaries in either ``onefile`` or ``onedir`` build are signed
with their identity. This is useful because for ``onefile`` builds,
signing of embedded binaries cannot be performed in a post-processing step.

.. note::
   When codesign identity is specified, |PyInstaller| also turns on
   *hardened runtime* by passing ``--options=runtime`` to the ``codesign``
   command. This requires the codesign identity to be a valid Apple-issued
   code signing certificate, and will not work with self-signed certificates.

   Trying to use self-signed certificate as a codesign identity will result
   in shared libraries failing to load, with the following reason reported:

      `[libname]: code signature in ([libname]) not valid for use in process
      using Library Validation: mapped file has no Team ID and is not a
      platform binary (signed with custom identity or adhoc?)`

Furthermore, it is possible to specify entitlements file to be used
when signing the collected binaries and the executable. This can be
done in the ``.spec`` file via ``entitlements_file=`` argument to
``EXE()``, or on command-line via the :option:`--osx-entitlements-file` switch.

App bundles
~~~~~~~~~~~

|PyInstaller| also automatically attempts to sign `.app bundles`, either
using ad-hoc identity or actual signing identity, if provided via
:option:`--codesign-identity` switch. In addition to passing same options as
when signing collected binaries (identity, hardened runtime, entitlement),
deep signing is also enabled via by passing ``--deep`` option to the
``codesign`` utility.

Should the signing of the bundle fail for whatever reason, the error
message from the ``codesign`` utility will be printed to the console,
along with a warning that manual intervention and manual signing of the
bundle are required.
