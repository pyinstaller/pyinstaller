License
=======

PyInstaller is distributed under a dual-licensing scheme using both the GPL 2.0 License, with
an exception that allows you to use it to build commercial products - listed below - and the
Apache License, version 2.0, which only applies to a certain few files. To see which files the Apache
license applies to, and to which the GPL applies, please see the `COPYING.txt` file which can be
found in the root of the PyInstaller source repository.

A quick summary of the GPL license exceptions:

  - You may use PyInstaller to bundle commercial applications out of your
    source code.

  - The executable bundles generated by PyInstaller from your source code can be
    shipped with whatever license you want, as long as it complies with the
    licenses of your dependencies. You do not need to include PyInstaller's
    license file with your application, nor do you have to provide any form of
    acknowledgements or credits to PyInstaller (e.g. in an *About* dialog).

  - You may modify PyInstaller for your own needs but changes to the
    PyInstaller source code fall under the terms of the GPL license.
    That is, if you distribute your modifications you must distribute
    them under GPL terms.
