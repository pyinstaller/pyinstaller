\.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBpyi\-makespec\fP <options> SCRIPT [SCRIPT ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The spec file is the description of what you want \fIPyInstaller\fP to do
with your program. \fBpyi\-makespec\fP is a simple wizard to create spec
files that cover basic usages:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
pyi\-makespec [\-\-onefile] yourprogram.py
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
By default, \fBpyi\-makespec\fP generates a spec file that tells
\fIPyInstaller\fP to create a distribution directory contains the main
executable and the dynamic libraries. The option \fB\-\-onefile\fP
specifies that you want PyInstaller to build a single file with
everything inside.
.sp
In most cases the specfile generated by \fBpyi\-makespec\fP is all you
need. If not, see \fIWhen things go wrong\fP in the manual and be sure to
read the introduction to \fISpec Files\fP\&.

.SS What To Bundle, Where To Search
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-add\-data \ <SRC;DEST or SRC:DEST>
Additional non\-binary files or folders to be added to the executable. The

.SS How To Generate
.sp
\-d {all,imports,bootloader,noarchive}, \-\-debug {all,imports,bootloader,noarchive}
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
R|Provide assistance with debugging a frozen application. This argument may
be provided multiple times to select several of the following options. \-
all: All three of the following options. \- imports: specify the \-v option
to the underlying Python interpreter, causing it to print a message each
time a module is initialized, showing the place (filename or built\-in
module) from which it is loaded. See
\fI\%https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#id4\fP\&. \- bootloader: tell the
bootloader to issue progress messages while initializing and starting the
bundled app. Used to diagnose problems with missing imports. \- noarchive:
instead of storing all frozen Python source files as an archive inside the
resulting executable, store them as files in the resulting output
directory.
.UNINDENT

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-python\-option \ PYTHON_OPTION
Specify a command\-line option to pass to the Python interpreter at runtime.
Currently supports "v" (equivalent to "\-\-debug imports"), "u", and "W
<warning control>".
.TP
.B \-s\fP,\fB  \-\-strip
Apply a symbol\-table strip to the executable and shared libs (not
recommended for Windows)
.TP
.B \-\-noupx
Do not use UPX even if it is available (works differently between Windows
and *nix)
.TP
.BI \-\-upx\-exclude \ FILE
Prevent a binary from being compressed when using upx. This is typically
used if upx corrupts certain binaries during compression. FILE is the
filename of the binary without path. This option can be used multiple
times.
.UNINDENT
.SS Windows And Mac Os X Specific Options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-c\fP,\fB  \-\-console\fP,\fB  \-\-nowindowed
Open a console window for standard i/o (default). On Windows this option
has no effect if the first script is a \(aq.pyw\(aq file.
.TP
.B \-w\fP,\fB  \-\-windowed\fP,\fB  \-\-noconsole
Windows and Mac OS X: do not provide a console window for standard i/o. On
Mac OS this also triggers building a Mac OS .app bundle. On Windows this
option is automatically set if the first script is a \(aq.pyw\(aq file. This
option is ignored on *NIX systems.
.TP
.BI \-i \ <FILE.ico or FILE.exe,ID or FILE.icns or "NONE">\fR,\fB \ \-\-icon \ <FILE.ico or FILE.exe,ID or FILE.icns or "NONE">
FILE.ico: apply the icon to a Windows executable. FILE.exe,ID: extract the
icon with ID from an exe. FILE.icns: apply the icon to the .app bundle on
Mac OS. Use "NONE" to not apply any icon, thereby making the OS to show
some default (default: apply PyInstaller\(aqs icon)
.TP
.B \-\-disable\-windowed\-traceback
Disable traceback dump of unhandled exception in windowed (noconsole) mode
(Windows and macOS only), and instead display a message that this feature
is disabled.
.UNINDENT
.SS Windows Specific Options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-version\-file \ FILE
Add a version resource from FILE to the exe.
.TP
.BI \-m \ <FILE or XML>\fR,\fB \ \-\-manifest \ <FILE or XML>
Add manifest FILE or XML to the exe.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-embed\-manifest
Generate an external .exe.manifest file instead of embedding the manifest
into the exe. Applicable only to onedir mode; in onefile mode, the manifest
is always embedded, regardless of this option.
.TP
.BI \-r \ RESOURCE\fR,\fB \ \-\-resource \ RESOURCE
Add or update a resource to a Windows executable. The RESOURCE is one to
four items, FILE[,TYPE[,NAME[,LANGUAGE]]]. FILE can be a data file or an
exe/dll. For data files, at least TYPE and NAME must be specified. LANGUAGE
defaults to 0 or may be specified as wildcard * to update all resources of
the given TYPE and NAME. For exe/dll files, all resources from FILE will be
added/updated to the final executable if TYPE, NAME and LANGUAGE are
omitted or specified as wildcard *. This option can be used multiple
times.
.TP
.B \-\-uac\-admin
Using this option creates a Manifest that will request elevation upon
application start.
.TP
.B \-\-uac\-uiaccess
Using this option allows an elevated application to work with Remote
Desktop.
.UNINDENT
.SS Windows Side\-By\-Side Assembly Searching Options (Advanced)
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-win\-private\-assemblies
Any Shared Assemblies bundled into the application will be changed into
Private Assemblies. This means the exact versions of these assemblies will
always be used, and any newer versions installed on user machines at the
system level will be ignored.
.TP
.B \-\-win\-no\-prefer\-redirects
While searching for Shared or Private Assemblies to bundle into the
application, PyInstaller will prefer not to follow policies that redirect
to newer versions, and will try to bundle the exact versions of the
assembly.
.UNINDENT
.SS Mac Os Specific Options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-osx\-bundle\-identifier \ BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER
Mac OS .app bundle identifier is used as the default unique program name
for code signing purposes. The usual form is a hierarchical name in reverse
DNS notation. For example: com.mycompany.department.appname (default: first
script\(aqs basename)
.TP
.BI \-\-target\-architecture \ ARCH\fR,\fB \ \-\-target\-arch \ ARCH
Target architecture (macOS only; valid values: x86_64, arm64, universal2).
Enables switching between universal2 and single\-arch version of frozen
application (provided python installation supports the target
architecture). If not target architecture is not specified, the current
running architecture is targeted.
.TP
.BI \-\-codesign\-identity \ IDENTITY
Code signing identity (macOS only). Use the provided identity to sign
collected binaries and generated executable. If signing identity is not
provided, ad\-hoc signing is performed instead.
.TP
.BI \-\-osx\-entitlements\-file \ FILENAME
Entitlements file to use when code\-signing the collected binaries (macOS
only).
.UNINDENT
.SS Rarely Used Special Options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-runtime\-tmpdir \ PATH
Where to extract libraries and support files in \fIonefile\fP\-mode. If this
option is given, the bootloader will ignore any temp\-folder location
defined by the run\-time OS. The \fB_MEIxxxxxx\fP\-folder will be created here.
Please use this option only if you know what you are doing.
.TP
.B \-\-bootloader\-ignore\-signals
Tell the bootloader to ignore signals rather than forwarding them to the
child process. Useful in situations where for example a supervisor process
signals both the bootloader and the child (e.g., via a process group) to
avoid signalling the child twice.
.UNINDENT
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B PYINSTALLER_CONFIG_DIR
This changes the directory where PyInstaller caches some files.
The default location for this is operating system dependent,
but is typically a subdirectory of the home directory.
