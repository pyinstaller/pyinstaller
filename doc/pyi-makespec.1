\.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBpyi\-makespec\fP <options> SCRIPT [SCRIPT ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The spec file is the description of what you want \fIPyInstaller\fP to do
with your program. \fBpyi\-makespec\fP is a simple wizard to create spec
files that cover basic usages:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
py\-Makespec [\-\-onefile] yourprogram.py
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
By default, \fBpyi\-makespec\fP generates a spec file that tells
\fIPyInstaller\fP to create a distribution directory contains the main
executable and the dynamic libraries. The option \fB\-\-onefile\fP
specifies that you want PyInstaller to build a single file with
everything inside.
.sp
In most cases the specfile generated by \fBpyi\-makespec\fP is all you
need. If not, see \fIWhen things go wrong\fP in the manual and be sure to
read the introduction to \fISpec Files\fP\&.

Create a one\-file bundled executable.
.TP
.BI \-\-specpath \ DIR
Folder to store the generated spec file (default:
current directory)
.TP
.BI \-n \ NAME\fP,\fB \ \-\-name \ NAME
Name to assign to the bundled app and spec file
(default: first script\(aqs basename)
.UNINDENT
.SS What to bundle, where to search
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-p \ DIR\fP,\fB \ \-\-paths \ DIR
A path to search for imports (like using PYTHONPATH).
Multiple paths are allowed, separated by \(aq:\(aq, or use
this option multiple times
.TP
.BI \-\-hidden\-import \ MODULENAME\fP,\fB \ \-\-hiddenimport \ MODULENAME
Name an import not visible in the code of the
script(s). This option can be used multiple times.

.BI \-\-additional\-hooks\-dir \ HOOKSPATH
An additional path to search for hooks. This option
can be used multiple times.
.TP
.BI \-\-runtime\-hook \ RUNTIME_HOOKS
Path to a custom runtime hook file. A runtime hook is
code that is bundled with the executable and is
executed before any other code or module to set up
special features of the runtime environment. This
option can be used multiple times.
.TP
.BI \-\-exclude\-module \ EXCLUDES
Optional module or package (his Python names, not path
names) that will be ignored (as though it was not
found). This option can be used multiple times.

.UNINDENT
.SS How to generate
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-d\fP,\fB  \-\-debug
Tell the bootloader to issue progress messages while
initializing and starting the bundled app. Used to
diagnose problems with missing imports.
.TP
.B \-s\fP,\fB  \-\-strip
Apply a symbol\-table strip to the executable and
shared libs (not recommended for Windows)

.TP
.B \-c\fP,\fB  \-\-console\fP,\fB  \-\-nowindowed
Open a console window for standard i/o (default)
.TP
.B \-w\fP,\fB  \-\-windowed\fP,\fB  \-\-noconsole
Windows and Mac OS X: do not provide a console window
for standard i/o. On Mac OS X this also triggers
building an OS X .app bundle. This option is ignored
in *NIX systems.
.TP
.BI \-i \ <FILE.ico or FILE.exe,ID or FILE.icns>\fP,\fB \ \-\-icon \ <FILE.ico or FILE.exe,ID or FILE.icns>
FILE.ico: apply that icon to a Windows executable.
FILE.exe,ID, extract the icon with ID from an exe.
FILE.icns: apply the icon to the .app bundle on Mac OS
X
.UNINDENT
.SS Windows specific options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-version\-file \ FILE
add a version resource from FILE to the exe
.TP
.BI \-m \ <FILE or XML>\fP,\fB \ \-\-manifest \ <FILE or XML>

.SS Windows Side\-by\-side Assembly searching options (advanced)
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-win\-private\-assemblies
Any Shared Assemblies bundled into the application
will be changed into Private Assemblies. This means
the exact versions of these assemblies will always be
used, and any newer versions installed on user
machines at the system level will be ignored.
.TP
.B \-\-win\-no\-prefer\-redirects
While searching for Shared or Private Assemblies to
bundle into the application, PyInstaller will prefer
not to follow policies that redirect to newer
versions, and will try to bundle the exact versions of
